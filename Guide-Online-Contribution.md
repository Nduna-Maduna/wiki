# Contributing to the Wiki directly from the browser
In an effort to make contributing to the wiki and to [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp) in general, this tutorial will walk you though the process step by step.

## Requirements
1. Stable internet connection.
2. A [GitHub](https://github.com) Account. If you don't have one then click [here](https://github.com/join) to create one.
3. Learning to [write on Github.](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) A quick referenced to [GitHub Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Instructions
Navigate to the [Wiki.](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki) You will encounter something similar to the image in figure _1a_ bellow. This will give you three options to add changes for your [pull requests.](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) They are by no means numbered in the way you should try then, I just went from left to right. Each one have their purpose.

### 1. New Pull Request Button
This is used to create [pull requests](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/How-To-Create-A-Pull-Request-for-Free-Code-Camp) from files that are already in existing branches, no really for adding new files. So if you are looking to add new files then check the other options.

### 2. New File Button
This is the option to choose if you want to directly create your files and submit a pull request from the browser. Unlike the **New Pull Request** button, this option allows you to create new files.

### 3. Upload Files Button
If you have already created the files, which should be `.md` files for **Markdown** or if you are contributing source code then feel free to use the adequate file extension.

After you select it, you will see something similar to _Figure 3a_ bellow. You have the following options:
- ** Drag or select files to upload:** This allows you to actually add the files, any files so be careful with what you upload.
- **Remove Files:** If you press the `x` it will remove the unwanted files before you proceed.
- **Add Title:** This will let you add a title for your pull request. Please try to use a self descriptive but short title. You will have a place to add as much details as you like.
- **Add Details:** Bellow the title you can add extra information using Github markdown. This means you can add links, images, videos, checklist, and everything that is supported. Please see link on the Requirements section.
- **Select how to contribute:** If you have write access like me then you can commit directly which is strongly advised not to do even for the core team. However, regular users will be unable to select this option anyway. The best way is to create a new branch for the pull request as seen on _Figure 3b_. This allows you to write a name for the branch. It is suggested to use a descriptive name that will give a glimpse of what the branch is about, for example `wiki-guide` for this guide, or `Palindromes` for an article about palindromes. The name shown on the image in an example of a **bad name!**

After you select your files, you will be presented with a screen like _Figure 3b & Figure 3c_ where you have the options to:
- **Change Base branch:** Always select master unless you know what you are doing, the base should be the target branch.
- **Compare to branch:** This should be the branch you create for your pull request.
